# BundleServer - A simple HTTP server for use with Bundlefly

BundleServer serves the contents of any directory you open, advertising the service via Bonjour using the type _bundleflyhttp._tcp.
It is meant to be used in conjunction with [Bundlefly](https://github.com/darrylhthomas/Bundlefly).

Both Bundleserver and Bundlefly are still under initial development and are very rough around the edges. I wouldn't suggest you use them yet.
